Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan record a high adult literacy rate of over 90%.[citation needed] The average rate of adult literacy shows steady improvement, and the absolute number of adult illiterates fell from 64 million to around 58\xa0million between 1990 and 2000â€“2004. Overall, the gender disparity in adult literacy is high in this region, and of the illiteracy rate, women account for two-thirds, with only 69 literate women for every 100 literate men. The average GPI (Gender Parity Index) for adult literacy is 0.72, and gender disparity can be observed in Egypt, Morocco, and Yemen. Above all, the GPI of Yemen is only 0.46 in a 53% adult literacy rate.[35] According to a UN survey, in the Arab world, the average person reads four pages a year and one new title is published each year for every 12,000 people.[36] The Arab Thought Foundation reports that just above 8% of people in Arab countries aspire to get an education.[36]\n',
